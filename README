Requirements:

VDR and a spoon for the soup.

Description:

The "Soppalusikka" is a standalone skin providing the good old "ElchiAIO" looks.

Installation:

tar -xzf /put/your/path/here/vdr-skinsoppalusikka-X.Y.Z.tgz
make -C skinsoppalusikka-X.Y.Z install

Configuration:

Channel logo directory can be given via a command line option (-l) and
it defaults to "skinsoppalusikka" subdirectory in VDR's resorce directory
for plugins.

Notes:

- Only XPM format is supported for channel logos: 64x48 pixels and
  13 colors (6 colors on DXR3) or less recommended. Colors must be
  defined in hex numbers only.

- If you'll add new channels logos on the fly, remember to flush the
  channel logo cache.

- The channel logos can be named according to channel name (YLETV2.xpm)
  or channel id (T-8438-4097-33.xpm). The naming is case-sensitive and
  the plugin prefers channel ids as a naming scheme. All '/' characters
  in channel names shall be automatically converted to '~' characters
  in filenames.

- There have been bug reports from some DXR3 users about vanishing
  colors and flickering. However, the skin is also reported to work
  without any problems on many DXR3 setups.

- An example of ImageMagick syntax for generating Soppalusikka compatible
  logos:
  shell> convert ChannelLogo.jpg -resize 64x48 -background "#FEFEFE" \
         -gravity center -extent 64x48 -colors 6 -depth 8 \
         "Channel Name.xpm"
